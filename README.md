# Password2Go
Simple password manager tool

## About
In the modern world, each \*paste anything here\* requires a password. In the past I used one simple password for "not important" \*anything here\*. But more and more \*anythings\* require complex passwords - one capital letter, one digit, one special symbol ... you probably also suffer from this.

In general, I do not want to store passwords on the Internet. There was an option to use the already created program, but I'm a programmer - I will write my own :)

Now the program is fully functional. The first time it starts it will prompt you to generate the keys to encrypt the passwords (and enter the password to protect the keys) and specify the path to the directory in which the database file will be created. I prefer to store the keys locally and the database file in the cloud.

### Some things TODO
Password generator! Absolutely forgot about him...

Key management for multiple keys (add ability to encrypt passwords with different keys).

Image and Document private card.
